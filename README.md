The Libft (library functions) project is the first assignment at 42 Ecole, where you will recode standard C library functions. This project helps strengthen your understanding of C programming fundamentals. Participants learn by applying concepts such as memory management, arrays, and character processing. Libft allows students to create their own libraries and gain a deeper mastery of the C language.
